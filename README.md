# Active Directory

## Objective
I’ve been working on an exciting project where I’m setting up an Active Directory home lab, complete with Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The goal is to explore how a domain environment functions, learn how to ingest events into a SIEM, and generate telemetry based on real-world attacks to improve detection capabilities. It’s a brilliant hands-on way to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity and IT, especially getting hands on experince when being passionate about detecting and responding to threats.
